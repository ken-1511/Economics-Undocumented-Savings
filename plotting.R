# plotting.R
# -----------
# This script creates four plots:
# 1. Average Savings Rate by Citizenship over time (y-axis limited to -20 to 20).
# 2. Average Household Size (RHNUMPER) by Citizenship over time.
# 3. Weighted Average Savings Rate (weighted by RHNUMPER) by Citizenship over time (y-axis -20 to 20).
# 4. Average Savings Rate by Ethnicity (Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic) over time (y-axis -20 to 20).
#
# All plots are saved in the folder "./Plots/" with descriptive filenames ending with "feb11".
#
# Assumptions: SIPP_savings contains the variables:
#   year, SR, citizenship, RHNUMPER, EORIGIN.
# For ethnicity, we assume EORIGIN==2 indicates Hispanic; all others are Non-Hispanic.
