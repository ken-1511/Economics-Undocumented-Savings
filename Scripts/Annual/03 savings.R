# sipp_match.R
# -----------
# This script computes the savings rate (SR) for each household (main respondent)
# that has more than one year of data.
#
# For each household (identified by SSUID), we first order the records by year.
# We then compute:
#   FVS = adjusted_net_worth_current - 1.07 * prev_adjusted_net_worth
#
# Next, we compute the average monthly savings (AMS) as the present value equivalent:
#   AMS = FVS / denom, where 
#     denom = (1 - (1 + r)^(-12)) / r, with r = 0.07/12.
#
# Finally, we compute the savings rate (SR) as:
#   SR = (AMS / household_income) * 100.
#
# We then replace any SR above 100 or below â€“100 with NA.
#
# Only households with at least two years of data are included (i.e. rows with a valid
# previous year's adjusted net worth). The new column 'prev_adjusted_net_worth' is retained
# in the final output.
#
# The final dataset, SIPP_savings, includes all original columns from SIPP_wrangled plus
# the new columns 'SR' and 'prev_adjusted_net_worth'.
